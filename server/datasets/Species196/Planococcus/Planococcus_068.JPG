Sekora and William Crow</p><p class="card-text">This document provides a comprehensive overview of the citrus nematode Tylenchulus semipenetrans (Cobb 1913), including its discovery, distribution, physical characteristics, life cycle, host range, symptoms of infestation, economic impact, and management strategies. The nematode is a significant pest in citrus-growing regions worldwide, causing slow decline in citrus trees. Effective management practices, such as the use of resistant rootstocks and certified propagative plants, are crucial for mitigating the damage caused by this nematode and improving citrus production.

Grabau</p><p class="card-text">The nematode Heterodera glycines, known as soybean cyst nematode (SCN), is the most economically damaging pest of soybean crops in the United States and around the world. Members of the Heteroderidae family belong in the order Tylenchida; most are plant parasitic while some are insect parasites. They are obligate parasites that attack different species of crops and weeds. Heteroderidae are divided into two groups: cyst and cystoid based on morphological alterations in their skin. The cyst group are unique in that the female skin changes, transforming into a hardened cyst that protects her eggs. Unlike many plant parasites, there may be little to no aboveground evidence of an infestation with H. glycines. They are extremely damaging to the agricultural economy and impossible to eradicate once established, but with proper management, it is possible to minimize H. glycines populations and maximize yield.</p></div></a></div></div><div class="mb-4 news-col academics year-2020"><div class="card news-card"><a href="/publication/IN1427" class="news-card-link no-animation"><div style="position:relative"><img alt="thumbnail for publication: Snowbush spanworm (larva), white-tipped black (adult), Melanchroia chephise (Stoll) (Insecta: Lepidoptera; Geometridae: Melanchroia)" loading="lazy" width="496" height="496" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:100%;width:100%" srcSet="/image/IN1427\D280qsi9s8\thumbnail/IN1427-thumbnail-320.webp 1x, /image/IN1427\D280qsi9s8\thumbnail/IN1427-thumbnail-640.webp 2x" src="/image/IN1427\D280qsi9s8\thumbnail/IN1427-thumbnail-640.webp"/><div style="position:absolute;bottom:0;right:0;width:20px;height:20px;text-align:center;opacity:0.75;cursor:pointer;background-color:lightgray" title="This Image was created by UF/IFAS"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-info" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-info " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" style="width:15px;color:black;margin-bottom:1px"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zM216 336h24V272H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24h48c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v88h8c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24s-10.7 24-24 24H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24zm40-208a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-title">Snowbush spanworm (larva), white-tipped black (adult), Melanchroia chephise (Stoll) (Insecta: Lepidoptera; Geometridae: Melanchroia)</h3><p class="card-date">Kaydie McCormick and Adam Dale</p><p class="card-text">Melanchroia chephise, commonly known as the snowbush spanworm or white-tipped black, is an occasional insect pest of snowbush shrubs and several other ornamental plant species. Found throughout the southern United States, these gregarious moth caterpillars can commonly be found defoliating their chosen hosts soon after they emerge en masse. The colorful appearance of the caterpillars may be alarming, but they pose little risk to people, and usually offer no lasting harm to the plants they feed on. The adult moths, with their black and white wings, can be an attractive addition to a pollinator garden. This publication describes how to identify this insect and provides in-depth information on its biology, development, and management.</p></div></a></div></div><div class="mb-4 news-col academics year-2020"><div class="card news-card"><a href="/publication/IN1395" class="news-card-link no-animation"><div style="position:relative"><img alt="thumbnail for publication: Twin-flagged Jumping Spider Anasaitis canosa (Walckenaer, 1837) (Arachnida: Araneae: Salticidae)" loading="lazy" width="496" height="496" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:100%;width:100%" srcSet="/image/IN1395\D3vvyug77w\thumbnail/IN1395-thumbnail-320.webp 1x, /image/IN1395\D3vvyug77w\thumbnail/IN1395-thumbnail-640.webp 2x" src="/image/IN1395\D3vvyug77w\thumbnail/IN1395-thumbnail-640.webp"/><div style="position:absolute;bottom:0;right:0;width:20px;height:20px;text-align:center;opacity:0.75;cursor:pointer;background-color:lightgray" title="This Image is used with permission of an outside source"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-info" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-info " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" style="width:15px;color:black;margin-bottom:1px"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zM216 336h24V272H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24h48c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v88h8c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24s-10.7 24-24 24H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24zm40-208a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-title">Twin-flagged Jumping Spider Anasaitis canosa (Walckenaer, 1837) (Arachnida: Araneae: Salticidae)</h3><p class="card-date">Kayla Stalcup, Lisa Taylor, and Erin Powell</p><p class="card-text">A UF/IFAS numbered publication.  </p></div></a></div></div><div class="mb-4 news-col academics year-2020"><div class="card news-card"><a href="/publication/IN1399" class="news-card-link no-animation"><div style="position:relative"><img alt="thumbnail for publication: Weevil Parasitoid, Pteromalid Wasp, Parasitoid Wasp Catolaccus hunteri Crawford (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)" loading="lazy" width="496" height="496" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:100%;width:100%" srcSet="/image/IN1399\D67huslgki\thumbnail/IN1399-thumbnail-320.webp 1x, /image/IN1399\D67huslgki\thumbnail/IN1399-thumbnail-640.webp 2x" src="/image/IN1399\D67huslgki\thumbnail/IN1399-thumbnail-640.webp"/><div style="position:absolute;bottom:0;right:0;width:20px;height:20px;text-align:center;opacity:0.75;cursor:pointer;background-color:lightgray" title="This Image is used with permission of an outside source"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-info" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-info " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" style="width:15px;color:black;margin-bottom:1px"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zM216 336h24V272H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24h48c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v88h8c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24s-10.7 24-24 24H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24zm40-208a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-title">Weevil Parasitoid, Pteromalid Wasp, Parasitoid Wasp Catolaccus hunteri Crawford (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)</h3><p class="card-date">Victoria Oluwaseun Adeleye, Dakshina Seal, Garima Garima, and Adam Dale</p><p class="card-text">The Featured Creatures collection provides in-depth profiles of insects, nematodes, arachnids and other organisms relevant to Florida.

Kuhlman and Adam G. Dale</p><p class="card-text">This publication describes the identification, biology, and importance of the American sand wasps (Bembix americana Fabricius), which are a subspecies-complex of large, robust wasps in the subfamily Bembicinae. They nest gregariously in bare soil and provision their nests with flies (order Diptera). The females are progressive provisioners, meaning they continue to provide their developing larvae with prey until the larvae pupate. Males participate in a distinctive mating behavior called a “sun dance” in which groups of males fly low over nesting areas waiting for females to emerge so they can be the first to mate with them. Adults feed on flower nectar and can often be found visiting a variety of wildflowers. This species has a broad ecological range and can be found nesting in a variety of soil types and habitats.</p></div></a></div></div><div class="mb-4 news-col academics year-2020"><div class="card news-card"><a href="/publication/IN1392" class="news-card-link no-animation"><div style="position:relative"><img alt="thumbnail for publication: Culex coronator (Dyar &amp; Knab) (Insecta: Diptera: Culicidae)" loading="lazy" width="496" height="496" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:100%;width:100%" srcSet="/image/IN1392\Daoy3jqlnb\thumbnail/IN1392-thumbnail-320.webp 1x, /image/IN1392\Daoy3jqlnb\thumbnail/IN1392-thumbnail-640.webp 2x" src="/image/IN1392\Daoy3jqlnb\thumbnail/IN1392-thumbnail-640.webp"/><div style="position:absolute;bottom:0;right:0;width:20px;height:20px;text-align:center;opacity:0.75;cursor:pointer;background-color:lightgray" title="This Image is used with permission of an outside source"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-info" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-info " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" style="width:15px;color:black;margin-bottom:1px"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zM216 336h24V272H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24h48c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v88h8c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24s-10.7 24-24 24H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24zm40-208a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-title">Culex coronator (Dyar &amp; Knab) (Insecta: Diptera: Culicidae)</h3><p class="card-date">Sierra M.

Although it occurs mostly in temperate regions, &lt;em&gt;Illinoia liriodendri &lt;/em&gt;can be found in most places where tulip poplar is grown. While its effects are recognized to be mostly aesthetic, heavy infestations of tuliptree aphid can significantly impact young trees, and they are considered the most important insect pest of this tree species in urban landscapes.

Members of the Heteroderidae family belong in the order Tylenchida; most are plant parasitic while some are insect parasites. They are obligate parasites that attack different species of crops and weeds. Heteroderidae are divided into two groups: cyst and cystoid based on morphological alterations in their skin. The cyst group are unique in that the female skin changes, transforming into a hardened cyst that protects her eggs. Unlike many plant parasites, there may be little to no aboveground evidence of an infestation with H. glycines. They are extremely damaging to the agricultural economy and impossible to eradicate once established, but with proper management, it is possible to minimize H. glycines populations and maximize yield.</p></div></a></div></div><div class="mb-4 news-col academics year-2020"><div class="card news-card"><a href="/publication/IN1427" class="news-card-link no-animation"><div style="position:relative"><img alt="thumbnail for publication: Snowbush spanworm (larva), white-tipped black (adult), Melanchroia chephise (Stoll) (Insecta: Lepidoptera; Geometridae: Melanchroia)" loading="lazy" width="496" height="496" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:100%;width:100%" srcSet="/image/IN1427\D280qsi9s8\thumbnail/IN1427-thumbnail-320.webp 1x, /image/IN1427\D280qsi9s8\thumbnail/IN1427-thumbnail-640.webp 2x" src="/image/IN1427\D280qsi9s8\thumbnail/IN1427-thumbnail-640.webp"/><div style="position:absolute;bottom:0;right:0;width:20px;height:20px;text-align:center;opacity:0.75;cursor:pointer;background-color:lightgray" title="This Image was created by UF/IFAS"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-info" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-info " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" style="width:15px;color:black;margin-bottom:1px"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zM216 336h24V272H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24h48c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v88h8c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24s-10.7 24-24 24H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24zm40-208a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-title">Snowbush spanworm (larva), white-tipped black (adult), Melanchroia chephise (Stoll) (Insecta: Lepidoptera; Geometridae: Melanchroia)</h3><p class="card-date">Kaydie McCormick and Adam Dale</p><p class="card-text">Melanchroia chephise, commonly known as the snowbush spanworm or white-tipped black, is an occasional insect pest of snowbush shrubs and several other ornamental plant species. Found throughout the southern United States, these gregarious moth caterpillars can commonly be found defoliating their chosen hosts soon after they emerge en masse. The colorful appearance of the caterpillars may be alarming, but they pose little risk to people, and usually offer no lasting harm to the plants they feed on. The adult moths, with their black and white wings, can be an attractive addition to a pollinator garden. This publication describes how to identify this insect and provides in-depth information on its biology, development, and management.</p></div></a></div></div><div class="mb-4 news-col academics year-2020"><div class="card news-card"><a href="/publication/IN1395" class="news-card-link no-animation"><div style="position:relative"><img alt="thumbnail for publication: Twin-flagged Jumping Spider Anasaitis canosa (Walckenaer, 1837) (Arachnida: Araneae: Salticidae)" loading="lazy" width="496" height="496" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:100%;width:100%" srcSet="/image/IN1395\D3vvyug77w\thumbnail/IN1395-thumbnail-320.webp 1x, /image/IN1395\D3vvyug77w\thumbnail/IN1395-thumbnail-640.webp 2x" src="/image/IN1395\D3vvyug77w\thumbnail/IN1395-thumbnail-640.webp"/><div style="position:absolute;bottom:0;right:0;width:20px;height:20px;text-align:center;opacity:0.75;cursor:pointer;background-color:lightgray" title="This Image is used with permission of an outside source"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-info" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-info " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" style="width:15px;color:black;margin-bottom:1px"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zM216 336h24V272H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24h48c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v88h8c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24s-10.7 24-24 24H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24zm40-208a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-title">Twin-flagged Jumping Spider Anasaitis canosa (Walckenaer, 1837) (Arachnida: Araneae: Salticidae)</h3><p class="card-date">Kayla Stalcup, Lisa Taylor, and Erin Powell</p><p class="card-text">A UF/IFAS numbered publication.  </p></div></a></div></div><div class="mb-4 news-col academics year-2020"><div class="card news-card"><a href="/publication/IN1399" class="news-card-link no-animation"><div style="position:relative"><img alt="thumbnail for publication: Weevil Parasitoid, Pteromalid Wasp, Parasitoid Wasp Catolaccus hunteri Crawford (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)" loading="lazy" width="496" height="496" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:100%;width:100%" srcSet="/image/IN1399\D67huslgki\thumbnail/IN1399-thumbnail-320.webp 1x, /image/IN1399\D67huslgki\thumbnail/IN1399-thumbnail-640.webp 2x" src="/image/IN1399\D67huslgki\thumbnail/IN1399-thumbnail-640.webp"/><div style="position:absolute;bottom:0;right:0;width:20px;height:20px;text-align:center;opacity:0.75;cursor:pointer;background-color:lightgray" title="This Image is used with permission of an outside source"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-info" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-info " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" style="width:15px;color:black;margin-bottom:1px"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zM216 336h24V272H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24h48c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v88h8c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24s-10.7 24-24 24H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24zm40-208a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-title">Weevil Parasitoid, Pteromalid Wasp, Parasitoid Wasp Catolaccus hunteri Crawford (Insecta: Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae)</h3><p class="card-date">Victoria Oluwaseun Adeleye, Dakshina Seal, Garima Garima, and Adam Dale</p><p class="card-text">The Featured Creatures collection provides in-depth profiles of insects, nematodes, arachnids and other organisms relevant to Florida.

Kuhlman and Adam G. Dale</p><p class="card-text">This publication describes the identification, biology, and importance of the American sand wasps (Bembix americana Fabricius), which are a subspecies-complex of large, robust wasps in the subfamily Bembicinae. They nest gregariously in bare soil and provision their nests with flies (order Diptera). The females are progressive provisioners, meaning they continue to provide their developing larvae with prey until the larvae pupate. Males participate in a distinctive mating behavior called a “sun dance” in which groups of males fly low over nesting areas waiting for females to emerge so they can be the first to mate with them. Adults feed on flower nectar and can often be found visiting a variety of wildflowers. This species has a broad ecological range and can be found nesting in a variety of soil types and habitats.</p></div></a></div></div><div class="mb-4 news-col academics year-2020"><div class="card news-card"><a href="/publication/IN1392" class="news-card-link no-animation"><div style="position:relative"><img alt="thumbnail for publication: Culex coronator (Dyar &amp; Knab) (Insecta: Diptera: Culicidae)" loading="lazy" width="496" height="496" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:100%;width:100%" srcSet="/image/IN1392\Daoy3jqlnb\thumbnail/IN1392-thumbnail-320.webp 1x, /image/IN1392\Daoy3jqlnb\thumbnail/IN1392-thumbnail-640.webp 2x" src="/image/IN1392\Daoy3jqlnb\thumbnail/IN1392-thumbnail-640.webp"/><div style="position:absolute;bottom:0;right:0;width:20px;height:20px;text-align:center;opacity:0.75;cursor:pointer;background-color:lightgray" title="This Image is used with permission of an outside source"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-info" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-info " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" style="width:15px;color:black;margin-bottom:1px"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zM216 336h24V272H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24h48c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v88h8c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24s-10.7 24-24 24H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24zm40-208a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-title">Culex coronator (Dyar &amp; Knab) (Insecta: Diptera: Culicidae)</h3><p class="card-date">Sierra M.

Grabau</p><p class="card-text">The nematode Heterodera glycines, known as soybean cyst nematode (SCN), is the most economically damaging pest of soybean crops in the United States and around the world. Members of the Heteroderidae family belong in the order Tylenchida; most are plant parasitic while some are insect parasites. They are obligate parasites that attack different species of crops and weeds. Heteroderidae are divided into two groups: cyst and cystoid based on morphological alterations in their skin. The cyst group are unique in that the female skin changes, transforming into a hardened cyst that protects her eggs. Unlike many plant parasites, there may be little to no aboveground evidence of an infestation with H. glycines. They are extremely damaging to the agricultural economy and impossible to eradicate once established, but with proper management, it is possible to minimize H. glycines populations and maximize yield.</p></div></a></div></div><div class="mb-4 news-col academics year-2020"><div class="card news-card"><a href="/publication/IN1436" class="news-card-link no-animation"><div style="position:relative"><img alt="thumbnail for publication: Tuliptree Aphid Scientific Name: Illinoia liriodendri (Monell) (Insecta: Hempitera: Aphididae)" loading="lazy" width="496" height="496" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" style="color:transparent;height:100%;width:100%" srcSet="/image/IN1436\Djnupwhs64\thumbnail/IN1436-thumbnail-320.webp 1x, /image/IN1436\Djnupwhs64\thumbnail/IN1436-thumbnail-640.webp 2x" src="/image/IN1436\Djnupwhs64\thumbnail/IN1436-thumbnail-640.webp"/><div style="position:absolute;bottom:0;right:0;width:20px;height:20px;text-align:center;opacity:0.75;cursor:pointer;background-color:lightgray" title="This Image was created by UF/IFAS"><svg aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" data-prefix="fas" data-icon="circle-info" class="svg-inline--fa fa-circle-info " role="img" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 512 512" style="width:15px;color:black;margin-bottom:1px"><path fill="currentColor" d="M256 512A256 256 0 1 0 256 0a256 256 0 1 0 0 512zM216 336h24V272H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24h48c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24v88h8c13.3 0 24 10.7 24 24s-10.7 24-24 24H216c-13.3 0-24-10.7-24-24s10.7-24 24-24zm40-208a32 32 0 1 1 0 64 32 32 0 1 1 0-64z"></path></svg></div></div><div class="card-body"><h3 class="card-title">Tuliptree Aphid Scientific Name: Illinoia liriodendri (Monell) (Insecta: Hempitera: Aphididae)</h3><p class="card-date">Lindsay Mikell and Adam Dale</p><p class="card-text">&lt;p&gt;The tuliptree aphid, &lt;em&gt;Illinoia liriodendri &lt;/em&gt;(Monell) is a sap-feeding insect herbivore of &lt;em&gt;Liriodendron tulipifera &lt;/em&gt;that commonly reaches high densities on trees planted in urban settings. &lt;em&gt;Liriodendron tulipifera &lt;/em&gt;is a large tree species native throughout eastern North America known commonly as tuliptree or tulip poplar.

Members of the Heteroderidae family belong in the order Tylenchida; most are plant parasitic while some are insect parasites. They are obligate parasites that attack different species of crops and weeds. Heteroderidae are divided into two groups: cyst and cystoid based on morphological alterations in their skin. The cyst group are unique in that the female skin changes, transforming into a hardened cyst that protects her eggs. Unlike many plant parasites, there may be little to no aboveground evidence of an infestation with H. glycines. They are extremely damaging to the agricultural economy and impossible to eradicate once established, but with proper management, it is possible to minimize H. glycines populations and maximize yield.","thumbnailImage":{"oid":"Dr3a8d1vpu","name":"IN1441-thumbnail","caption":null,"credit":null,"path":"IN1441\\D0rnim5qhy\\thumbnail","permissionFile":null,"permissionType":"uf","prompt":null,"permissionText":null,"licenseCode":null,"altText":null,"isDecorative":null,"description":null},"version":"1.0.0","experts":[{"expertOid":"16180474","dln":"IN1441","role":"author","sortOrder":2,"expert":{"oid":"16180474","name":"Grabau, Zane","description":"","bio":"\u003cp\u003eassociate professor, field crop nematology, UF/IFAS Department of Entomology and Nematology, Gainesville FL\u003c/p\u003e","affiliation":"University of Florida","profileUrl":"https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/zane-grabau-/","email":"zgrabau@ufl.edu","userEppn":"zgrabau@ufl.edu","headerImg":"Ag_DustyTractor1650","typeId":3,"orcidId":"0000-0001-6642-0903","ojsUserName":"zgrabau","status":"active","createdAt":null,"firstName":"Zane","lastName":"Grabau","middleInitial":" ","bios":[{"expertOid":"16180474","language":"en","bio":"\u003cp\u003eassociate professor, field crop nematology, UF/IFAS Department of Entomology and Nematology, Gainesville FL\u003c/p\u003e"}],"type":{"id":3,"description":"Specialist","ufAffiliated":true},"urls":[{"url":"a-grabauz","expertOid":"16180474","isPrimary":false},{"url":"zgrabau","expertOid":"16180474","isPrimary":true}],"qualifiers":[{"expertOid":"16180474","expertTypeQualifierId":1,"qualifier":{"id":1,"description":"current","ufAffiliated":true}}],"user":{"eppn":"zgrabau@ufl.edu","commonName":null,"ojsKey":null,"lastDownload":null,"directoryInfo":{"UFID":"04353901","FName":"Zane","LName":"Grabau","MI":" ","Email":"zgrabau@ufl.edu","UnitName":"Entomology and Nematology ","PrefName":"","UnitCode":"14 ","Photo":"613504820139.jpg                                  "}},"profiles":[{"id":1844,"expertOid":"16180474","label":"Entomology and Nematology Profile","profileUrl":"https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/zane-grabau-/"}]}}]}},{"collectionId":321,"dln":"IN1427","numberingLabel":null,"sortOrder":null,"releasedPublication":{"oid":"D280qsi9s8","dln":"IN1427","title":"Snowbush spanworm (larva), white-tipped black (adult), Melanchroia chephise (Stoll) (Insecta: Lepidoptera; Geometridae: Melanchroia)","authorByline":"Kaydie McCormick and Adam Dale","revisedAt":null,"publishedAt":"2024-05-20T00:00:00.000Z","abstract":"Melanchroia chephise, commonly known as the snowbush spanworm or white-tipped black, is an occasional insect pest of snowbush shrubs and several other ornamental plant species. Found throughout the southern United States, these gregarious moth caterpillars can commonly be found defoliating their chosen hosts soon after they emerge en masse. The colorful appearance of the caterpillars may be alarming, but they pose little risk to people, and usually offer no lasting harm to the plants they feed on. The adult moths, with their black and white wings, can be an attractive addition to a pollinator garden.

They nest gregariously in bare soil and provision their nests with flies (order Diptera). The females are progressive provisioners, meaning they continue to provide their developing larvae with prey until the larvae pupate. Males participate in a distinctive mating behavior called a “sun dance” in which groups of males fly low over nesting areas waiting for females to emerge so they can be the first to mate with them. Adults feed on flower nectar and can often be found visiting a variety of wildflowers. This species has a broad ecological range and can be found nesting in a variety of soil types and habitats.","thumbnailImage":{"oid":"Dz9kpesvzm","name":"IN1424-thumbnail","caption":null,"credit":null,"path":"IN1424\\D8x5syp8vh\\thumbnail","permissionFile":null,"permissionType":"uf","prompt":null,"permissionText":null,"licenseCode":null,"altText":null,"isDecorative":null,"description":null},"version":"1.0.0","experts":[{"expertOid":"1364966","dln":"IN1424","role":"author","sortOrder":2,"expert":{"oid":"1364966","name":"Dale, Adam G.","description":null,"bio":"\u003cp\u003eassociate professor, turfgrass and ornamental entomology, UF/IFAS Entomology and Nematology Department, Gainesville, FL\u003c/p\u003e","affiliation":"University of Florida","profileUrl":"https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/adam-dale/","email":"agdale@ufl.edu","userEppn":"agdale@ufl.edu","headerImg":null,"typeId":3,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4125-0431","ojsUserName":"adale","status":"active","createdAt":null,"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Dale","middleInitial":"G","bios":[{"expertOid":"1364966","language":"en","bio":"\u003cp\u003eassociate professor, turfgrass and ornamental entomology, UF/IFAS Entomology and Nematology Department, Gainesville, FL\u003c/p\u003e"}],"type":{"id":3,"description":"Specialist","ufAffiliated":true},"urls":[{"url":"a-daleag","expertOid":"1364966","isPrimary":false},{"url":"agdale","expertOid":"1364966","isPrimary":true}],"qualifiers":[{"expertOid":"1364966","expertTypeQualifierId":1,"qualifier":{"id":1,"description":"current","ufAffiliated":true}}],"user":{"eppn":"agdale@ufl.edu","commonName":null,"ojsKey":null,"lastDownload":null,"directoryInfo":{"UFID":"40859591","FName":"Adam","LName":"Dale","MI":"G","Email":"agdale@ufl.edu","UnitName":"Entomology and Nematology ","PrefName":"","UnitCode":"14 ","Photo":"618540829195.jpg                                  "}},"profiles":[{"id":2419,"expertOid":"1364966","label":"Entomology and Nematology Department Profile","profileUrl":"https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/adam-dale/"}]}}]}},{"collectionId":321,"dln":"IN1392","numberingLabel":null,"sortOrder":null,"releasedPublication":{"oid":"Daoy3jqlnb","dln":"IN1392","title":"Culex coronator (Dyar \u0026 Knab) (Insecta: Diptera: Culicidae)","authorByline":"Sierra M.

These profiles are intended for the use of interested laypersons with some knowledge of biology as well as academic audiences. This document provides an in-depth profile of the blueberry maggot, Rhagoletis mendax Curran, a significant pest of commercially grown blueberries. It covers the pest's introduction, distribution, taxonomy, description, host plants, life history, and control methods.

These profiles are intended for the use of interested laypersons with some knowledge of biology as well as academic audiences. This document provides an in-depth profile of the bromeliad pod borer, Epimorius testaceellus, a pyralid moth that damages the flower pods of the bromeliad Tillandsia fasciculata. It covers the moth's distribution, description, host plants, natural enemies, and behavior.

This document provides an in-depth profile of the cockroach egg parasitoid, Evania appendigaster (Linnaeus), detailing its identification, distribution, biology, and potential for biological control. Originating from the Orient, this wasp is now widespread in tropical and subtropical regions. It parasitizes cockroach egg cases, with the female inserting her ovipositor into the egg case to lay a single egg. The developing larva consumes all the cockroach eggs within the case. The document also discusses the wasp's competitors and its potential effectiveness in controlling cockroach populations.","thumbnailImage":{"oid":"Dlo4r1etf0","name":"IN319-thumbnail","caption":null,"credit":null,"path":"IN319\\D04mmjf94n\\thumbnail","permissionFile":null,"permissionType":"uf","prompt":null,"permissionText":null,"licenseCode":null,"altText":null,"isDecorative":null,"description":null},"version":"1.9.0","experts":[{"expertOid":"429245","dln":"IN319","role":null,"sortOrder":1,"expert":{"oid":"429245","name":null,"description":"\u003cp\u003eemeritus

Found in cattle across the Northern Hemisphere, the grub's larvae cause significant irritation and economic loss by damaging hides and reducing milk yield. The article discusses various control methods, including mechanical removal, insecticide treatments, and potential vaccines. Integrated management strategies, such as the sterile male-release technique, are also explored to mitigate the pest's impact on cattle health and productivity.

These profiles are intended for the use of interested laypersons with some knowledge of biology as well as academic audiences. This document provides an overview of the golden tortoise beetle, Charidotella bicolor, including its distribution, life cycle, and description. Found primarily in eastern North America, this beetle is known for its distinctive golden metallic color. The article details the beetle's life stages, from egg to adult, and its feeding habits on plants in the Convolvulaceae family. It also discusses natural enemies and management strategies, emphasizing that while the beetle can cause defoliation, it is rarely abundant enough to be considered a significant pest.","thumbnailImage":{"oid":"Dmxpfsz35f","name":"IN140-thumbnail","caption":null,"credit":null,"path":"IN140\\Dc84sgir95\\thumbnail","permissionFile":null,"permissionType":"other","prompt":null,"permissionText":null,"licenseCode":null,"altText":null,"isDecorative":null,"description":null},"version":"1.12.0","experts":[{"expertOid":"5774275","dln":"IN140","role":"contact only","sortOrder":2,"expert":{"oid":"5774275","name":"Rhodes, Elena M.","description":"","bio":"\u003cp\u003ebiological scientist III, UF/IFAS Entomology and Nematology Department, Gainesville, FL\u003c/p\u003e","affiliation":"University of Florida","profileUrl":"","email":"erhodes@ufl.edu","userEppn":"erhodes@ufl.edu","headerImg":"Food_Nutrition_Greens1650","typeId":6,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8465-8453","ojsUserName":"erhodes","status":"active","createdAt":null,"firstName":"Elena","lastName":"Rhodes","middleInitial":"M","bios":[{"expertOid":"5774275","language":"en","bio":"\u003cp\u003ebiological scientist III, UF/IFAS Entomology and Nematology Department, Gainesville, FL\u003c/p\u003e"}],"type":{"id":6,"description":"staff","ufAffiliated":true},"urls":[{"url":"erhodes","expertOid":"5774275","isPrimary":true}],"qualifiers":[{"expertOid":"5774275","expertTypeQualifierId":1,"qualifier":{"id":1,"description":"current","ufAffiliated":true}}],"user":{"eppn":"erhodes@ufl.edu","commonName":null,"ojsKey":null,"lastDownload":null,"directoryInfo":{"UFID":"91995121","FName":"Elena","LName":"Rhodes","MI":"M","Email":"erhodes@ufl.edu","UnitName":"Entomology and Nematology ","PrefName":"","UnitCode":"14 ","Photo":"                                                  "}},"profiles":[]}},{"expertOid":"6082504","dln":"IN140","role":null,"sortOrder":1,"expert":{"oid":"6082504","name":null,"description":null,"bio":"\u003cp\u003eprofessor emeritus (deceased) of integrated pest management and former department chairman, Department of Entomology and Nematology\u003c/p\u003e","affiliation":"University of Florida","profileUrl":null,"email":"capinera@ufl.edu","userEppn":"capinera@ufl.edu","headerImg":null,"typeId":1,"orcidId":null,"ojsUserName":null,"status":"active","createdAt":null,"firstName":"John","lastName":"Capinera","middleInitial":"L","bios":[{"expertOid":"6082504","language":"en","bio":"\u003cp\u003eprofessor emeritus (deceased) of integrated pest management and former department chairman, Department of Entomology and Nematology\u003c/p\u003e"}],"type":{"id":1,"description":"external","ufAffiliated":null},"urls":[{"url":"capinera","expertOid":"6082504","isPrimary":true}],"qualifiers":[],"user":{"eppn":"capinera@ufl.edu","commonName":null,"ojsKey":null,"lastDownload":null,"directoryInfo":null},"profiles":[]}}]}},{"collectionId":321,"dln":"IN288","numberingLabel":null,"sortOrder":313,"releasedPublication":{"oid":"Dxddqmqpm2","dln":"IN288","title":"Granulate Ambrosia Beetle Xylosandrus crassiusculus (Motschulsky) (Insecta: Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae)","authorByline":"Thomas.

The psyllid forms woody galls on hackberry leaf petioles, which are unsightly but not harmful to the host trees. The article details the appearance of adult and nymph stages, the formation and structure of galls, and the role of endosymbiotic bacteria in the psyllid's nutrition. It also discusses the parasitoids that affect the psyllid and the lack of need for control measures due to minimal tree damage.

The midge larvae mine the meristematic tissues of hydrilla, disrupting shoot growth and preventing new stems from reaching the surface. The article emphasizes the importance of integrated pest management and discusses the challenges and strategies for mass rearing and release of the midge to control hydrilla infestations. First published: August 1998.","thumbnailImage":{"oid":"D4qfh451p0","name":"IN211-thumbnail","caption":null,"credit":null,"path":"IN211\\Dg9id97vq4\\thumbnail","permissionFile":null,"permissionType":"other","prompt":null,"permissionText":null,"licenseCode":null,"altText":null,"isDecorative":null,"description":null},"version":"2.2.0","experts":[{"expertOid":"10373551","dln":"IN211","role":"former author","sortOrder":3,"expert":{"oid":"10373551","name":"Weeks, E.

Native to North and South America, this mosquito is prevalent in woodland environments with intermittent pools. While it is not a major vector for human pathogens, it is known for its persistent and painful bites. The article details the mosquito’s life cycle, distribution, and medical significance, highlighting its role in transmitting certain viruses in laboratory settings. Management recommendations include avoiding outdoor activities during peak mosquito activity and using EPA-registered repellents.","thumbnailImage":{"oid":"D4v7nfdyf0","name":"IN1100-thumbnail","caption":null,"credit":null,"path":"IN1100\\3387281\\thumbnail","permissionFile":null,"permissionType":"uf","prompt":null,"permissionText":null,"licenseCode":null,"altText":null,"isDecorative":null,"description":null},"version":"2.0.0","experts":[{"expertOid":"13741722","dln":"IN1100","role":null,"sortOrder":2,"expert":{"oid":"13741722","name":null,"description":null,"bio":"\u003cp\u003eformer professor, UF/IFAS Florida Medical Entomology Laboratory\u003c/p\u003e","affiliation":"University of Florida","profileUrl":null,"email":"ccr@ufl.edu","userEppn":"ccr@ufl.edu","headerImg":null,"typeId":1,"orcidId":"0000-0003-4141-347X","ojsUserName":null,"status":"deleted","createdAt":null,"firstName":"C.

These profiles are intended for the use of interested laypersons with some knowledge of biology as well as academic audiences. This document provides an overview of Protura, minute soil-inhabiting hexapods characterized by the lack of eyes and antennae, and a 12-segmented abdomen. It details their distribution, morphology, and life history, highlighting their unique development by anamorphosis. Protura are found worldwide in soil, leaf litter, and decaying wood. The article also discusses their collection methods and taxonomic classification, noting that Protura are now considered an order within the class Entognatha. The document emphasizes the need for further research to better understand their ecology and biology.

With its wings folded, it resembles a dead leaf and is highly cryptic. This document provides an in-depth profile of the question mark butterfly, Polygonia interrogationis, detailing its distribution, physical characteristics, life cycle, and natural enemies. Found throughout the eastern United States and southern Canada, this butterfly is known for its cryptic appearance resembling a dead leaf. The article describes the butterfly's distinct wing patterns, larval hosts, and feeding habits. It also highlights the butterfly's interactions with predators and parasitoids, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of its biology and ecology.

Feeding by Cyrtobagous salviniae larvae and adults kills its invasive host plants and restores recreational, agricultural, and ecosystem functions in aquatic systems. In the United states, the insect has been credited for controlling Salvinia minima in Florida and causing the decline of Salvinia molesta in Texas and Louisiana.\n","thumbnailImage":{"oid":"D12o5m4b67","name":"IN1245-thumbnail","caption":null,"credit":null,"path":"IN1245\\8909298\\thumbnail","permissionFile":null,"permissionType":"other","prompt":null,"permissionText":null,"licenseCode":null,"altText":null,"isDecorative":null,"description":null},"version":"1.0.0","experts":[{"expertOid":"1364966","dln":"IN1245","role":null,"sortOrder":3,"expert":{"oid":"1364966","name":"Dale, Adam G.","description":null,"bio":"\u003cp\u003eassociate professor, turfgrass and ornamental entomology, UF/IFAS Entomology and Nematology Department, Gainesville, FL\u003c/p\u003e","affiliation":"University of Florida","profileUrl":"https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/adam-dale/","email":"agdale@ufl.edu","userEppn":"agdale@ufl.edu","headerImg":null,"typeId":3,"orcidId":"0000-0002-4125-0431","ojsUserName":"adale","status":"active","createdAt":null,"firstName":"Adam","lastName":"Dale","middleInitial":"G","bios":[{"expertOid":"1364966","language":"en","bio":"\u003cp\u003eassociate professor, turfgrass and ornamental entomology, UF/IFAS Entomology and Nematology Department, Gainesville, FL\u003c/p\u003e"}],"type":{"id":3,"description":"Specialist","ufAffiliated":true},"urls":[{"url":"a-daleag","expertOid":"1364966","isPrimary":false},{"url":"agdale","expertOid":"1364966","isPrimary":true}],"qualifiers":[{"expertOid":"1364966","expertTypeQualifierId":1,"qualifier":{"id":1,"description":"current","ufAffiliated":true}}],"user":{"eppn":"agdale@ufl.edu","commonName":null,"ojsKey":null,"lastDownload":null,"directoryInfo":{"UFID":"40859591","FName":"Adam","LName":"Dale","MI":"G","Email":"agdale@ufl.edu","UnitName":"Entomology and Nematology ","PrefName":"","UnitCode":"14 ","Photo":"618540829195.jpg                                  "}},"profiles":[{"id":2419,"expertOid":"1364966","label":"Entomology and Nematology Department Profile","profileUrl":"https://entnemdept.ufl.edu/people-directory/adam-dale/"}]}},{"expertOid":"2478481","dln":"IN1245","role":null,"sortOrder":2,"expert":{"oid":"2478481","name":"Kariuki, Eutychus","description":"\u003cp\u003epost-doctoral associate, Ph.D., UF/IFAS Indian River Research and Education Center, Fort Pierce, FL\u003c/p\u003e","bio":"\u003cp\u003epost-doctoral associate, Ph.D., UF/IFAS Indian River Research and Education Center, Fort Pierce, FL\u003c/p\u003e","affiliation":"University of Florida","profileUrl":"","email":"eutychus.kariuki@ufl.edu","userEppn":"eutychus.kariuki@ufl.edu","headerImg":"NR_Kayak1650","typeId":5,"orcidId":"0000-0002-8144-9496","ojsUserName":"ufkariuki","status":"active","createdAt":null,"firstName":"Eutychus","lastName":"Kariuki","middleInitial":null,"bios":[{"expertOid":"2478481","language":"en","bio":"\u003cp\u003epost-doctoral associate, Ph.D., UF/IFAS Indian River Research and Education Center, Fort Pierce, FL\u003c/p\u003e"}],"type":{"id":5,"description":"postdoc","ufAffiliated":true},"urls":[{"url":"a-kariuki","expertOid":"2478481","isPrimary":false},{"url":"eutychus-kariuki","expertOid":"2478481","isPrimary":true}],"qualifiers":[{"expertOid":"2478481","expertTypeQualifierId":1,"qualifier":{"id":1,"description":"current","ufAffiliated":true}}],"user":{"eppn":"eutychus.kariuki@ufl.edu","commonName":null,"ojsKey":null,"lastDownload":null,"directoryInfo":null},"profiles":[]}}]}},{"collectionId":321,"dln":"IN223","numberingLabel":null,"sortOrder":576,"releasedPublication":{"oid":"Djc8bkfdcm","dln":"IN223","title":"Sand Field Cricket, Gryllus firmus Scudder (Insecta: Orthoptera: Gryllidae)","authorByline":"Thomas J.

This document provides an in-depth profile of the southern wood cricket, Gryllus fultoni, detailing its distribution, identification, life cycle, habitat, and song. Found throughout the southeastern US, this cricket is distinguished by its unique forewing patterns and stridulatory file. It overwinters as a juvenile and matures in spring, inhabiting various forest types. The calling song consists of fast-pulsed chirps.

It details the caterpillar's introduction, distribution, physical description, life cycle, and the minimal damage it causes to oleander plants. The document emphasizes that control measures are generally unnecessary due to the caterpillar's rarity and solitary feeding habits. Additionally, it highlights the role of natural predators and parasitoids in managing the population of this caterpillar species.

They can infest sidewalks, buildings and gardens, and damage phone lines, air conditioning units and computers.

These profiles are intended for the use of interested laypersons with some knowledge of biology as well as academic audiences. The yellowstriped armyworm (Spodoptera ornithogalli) is a common pest in the southeastern U.S., with a distribution extending from southern Canada to South America and the Caribbean. It undergoes three to four generations annually, with eggs laid in clusters and larvae initially gregarious before pupating in the soil. The larvae, which have variable coloration and distinct markings, feed on a wide range of crops and weeds, causing significant foliage damage. Natural enemies include various parasitoids and a nuclear polyhedrosis virus.
